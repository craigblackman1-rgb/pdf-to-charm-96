    question: "Do I need to be fit or healthy to start?",
    answer:
      "No. Most clients start from a point where conventional fitness feels inaccessible. You do not need to have exercised before, be at a particular weight, or be healthy in the conventional sense. The only starting point is where you are right now.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this suitable if I have an injury or medical condition?",
    answer:
      "Almost certainly yes. Esther is qualified in exercise referral and cancer rehabilitation, specifically trained to work with people who have clinical health conditions. Every programme is adapted to what your body can manage and adjusted as your health changes.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I train?",
    answer:
      "For most clients, two sessions per week is a good starting point. For those managing health conditions or recovering from illness, one session per week may be more appropriate initially. Esther will recommend a frequency that is sustainable and effective for your specific situation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer flexible packages?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Options include a single pay-as-you-go session at 45, a block of 12 for 480, or a block of 24 for 840. Every new client starts with a free 30-minute consultation — no commitment required.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where is the studio located?",
    answer:
      "Sessions take place in a private studio in Worthing, West Sussex — used exclusively for one-to-one training. No public gym floor, no other clients. The full address is confirmed at the point of booking.",
