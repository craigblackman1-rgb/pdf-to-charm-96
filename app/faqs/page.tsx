      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No. Most clients start from a point where conventional fitness feels inaccessible. You do not need to have exercised before, be at a particular weight, or be healthy in the conventional sense. The only starting point is where you are right now."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes. Esther holds a specialist qualification in cancer rehabilitation and has experience working with clients at all stages including during active treatment, in remission, and in long-term recovery. Every session is adapted to what your body can manage that day."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Almost certainly yes. Esther is qualified in exercise referral, which means she is specifically trained to work with people with clinical health conditions including heart conditions, diabetes, autoimmune conditions, fibromyalgia, ME/CFS, and many others."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "For most clients, two sessions per week is a good starting point. For those managing health conditions or recovering from illness, one session per week may be more appropriate initially. Esther will recommend a frequency that is sustainable and effective for your specific situation."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes. Esther is qualified in exercise referral and experienced in working alongside medical guidance. If you have been referred through a GP exercise scheme or have a recommendation from your doctor, she can work directly with that guidance."
