There was a time when exercise felt inaccessible, intimidating, and simply not something that was meant for me. When that changed, it changed everything — my health, my recovery, my sense of what my body was capable of.</p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground font-body text-base leading-relaxed mb-5">That experience is the reason I became a personal trainer. Not to help people lose weight or achieve an aesthetic ideal — but to help people rehabilitate, recover, and feel stronger, more capable, and more functional in their own bodies, regardless of their health conditions or limitations.</p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground font-body text-base leading-relaxed mb-8">I qualified to Level 4 — the highest personal training qualification in the UK — and went further with specialist certifications in Cancer Rehabilitation and Exercise Referral. I specifically sought these qualifications to work with people who have more complex medical needs: cancer treatment survivors, those with chronic health conditions, post-surgical recovery, disabilities, and clients whose health situations have led other trainers to say they cannot help. Those are exactly the clients I am here for.</p>

            <p className="text-muted-foreground font-body text-base leading-relaxed">I mention this not to boast, but because you might be wondering whether your situation is too complicated, too medically complex, or too much. It almost certainly is not. My Cancer Rehabilitation and Exercise Referral certifications equip me to work alongside your GP, specialist, and healthcare team. Every programme is built from scratch — with complete medical awareness and respect for whatever your body, health conditions, recovery status, or history looks like.</p>

              <p className="text-muted-foreground font-body text-base leading-relaxed mb-5">Eternal Fitness is not a weight loss service. It is not about transforming your body into something it is not. It is about rehabilitation and recovery — finding out what your body is capable of right now, with all the health conditions, medications, limitations, and recovery status it is currently dealing with — and building steadily from there.</p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground font-body text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">The goal is not a six-week result. It is returning to activities after cancer treatment. Being able to move with less pain. Having better fatigue management. Managing your chronic condition without fear. Recovering full function after injury. Climbing stairs. Walking further. Moving through life with more ease, capability, and confidence than before. That takes time, consistency, and working with someone who genuinely understands medical complexity and adjusts when your health or capacity changes. That is what I do.</p>
              <div className="bg-background rounded-2xl p-5 mb-6 border border-border shadow-md">
                <h4 className="text-foreground mb-2">More Than a Workout</h4>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground font-body text-base leading-relaxed">No weigh-ins. No before-and-after photos. No pressure to look a certain way. Just steady, meaningful progress — measured against your own baseline, not anyone else&apos;s.</p>
