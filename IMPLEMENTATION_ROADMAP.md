## SESSION 2: BLOG CONTENT REPOSITIONING
**Priority:** ⚠️ HIGH — Prevents off-brand content from ranking  
**Timeline:** 3-5 hours  
**Owner:** Content/Marketing

### Deliverables
- [ ] Delete 2 blog posts (weight-loss focused, no relevance)
- [ ] Reframe 3 blog posts (weight-loss → health conditions angle)
- [ ] Update all blog post author bylines

**Blog Posts to Handle:**

| Post | Action | New Title | New Angle |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| "Are you sabotaging your weight loss?" | ❌ DELETE | N/A | Contradicts specialist positioning |
| "Target fat loss to specific body parts?" | ❌ DELETE | N/A | Weight-loss only, no relevance |
| "Getting back on track when you fell off wagon" | 🔄 REFRAME | "Managing Setbacks in Your Recovery Journey" | Focus on health setbacks, not diet cheating |
| "Myth: Are low-fat foods healthy?" | 🔄 REFRAME | "Nutrition for Energy & Recovery (Not Weight Loss)" | Health/healing angle, not diet |
| "BMI outdated assessment" | 🔄 REFRAME | "Why BMI Doesn't Matter When You Have Health Conditions" | Health conditions > generic fitness |

**Task Description for New Session:**
```
You are updating blog posts for Eternal Fitness (specialist personal trainer for health conditions).

PROBLEM: 5 blog posts focus on weight loss. This contradicts the specialist positioning (health conditions, disabilities, cancer recovery - NOT weight loss).

TASK 1: Delete 2 Posts
In Supabase blog_posts table, delete:
1. "Are you sabotaging your weight loss?" (slug: are-you-sabotaging-your-weight-loss)
2. "Is it possible to target fat loss to specific body parts?" (slug: is-it-possible-to-target-fat-loss-to-specific-body-parts)

TASK 2: Reframe 3 Posts (Keep the posts, change the angle)

Post A: "Getting back on track when you've fallen off the wagon"
- Current angle: Weight-loss yo-yo dieting
- New title: "Managing Setbacks in Your Recovery Journey"
- New angle: For clients with health conditions/disabilities who experience setbacks in training
- Update first paragraph to clarify this is about health/capability recovery, not diet

Post B: "Myth: Are low-fat foods healthy?"
- Current angle: Diet/weight-loss focused
- New title: "Nutrition for Energy & Recovery (Not Weight Loss)"
- New angle: How to eat for healing/energy, not for weight loss
- Update first paragraph to reposition around health/recovery

Post C: "BMI an outdated & inaccurate assessment"
- Current angle: Weight-loss focused
- New title: "Why BMI Doesn't Matter When You Have Health Conditions"
- New angle: BMI is especially irrelevant for people with health conditions/disabilities
- Highlight: Muscle gain, bone density, functional capability matter more than BMI

TASK 3: Update Author Bylines
In Supabase blog_posts table, update author_name:
- Current: "Craig Blackman"
- New: "Esther Fair, Level 4 Personal Trainer, Cancer Rehabilitation Specialist"
- Apply to ALL 14 blog posts

Verification: 
- Deleted posts should return 404

## SESSION 4: UPDATE PAGE COPY FOR SPECIALIST POSITIONING
**Priority:** ⚠️ HIGH — Ensures messaging reinforces specialist ICP  
**Timeline:** 4-6 hours  
**Owner:** Copywriting/Marketing

### Deliverables
- [ ] Update About page copy (emphasize specialist credentials + complex health needs)
- [ ] Update Personal Training page copy (health conditions focus, remove generic language)
- [ ] Update Homepage sections (hero + key sections realigned to specialist messaging)

**Task Description for New Session:**
```
You are updating copy across 3 key pages for Eternal Fitness (specialist trainer for health conditions).

CONTEXT: The site was drafted with generic fitness language. Now we need to emphasize:
- Specialist focus: Health conditions, disabilities, cancer recovery
- Target audience: People who DON'T fit generic gyms/trainers
- Differentiation: Level 4 qualified + cancer rehab + exercise referral specialist
- Remove: Generic "transformation" language, weight-loss mentions

TASK 1: Update About Page
File: app/about/AboutPageClient.tsx

Changes needed in the story section:
- Remove generic "I wasn't confident at fitness" narrative (too common)
- Replace with: "I became a Level 4 trainer specifically to work with clients other trainers turn away"
- Add specific examples: "cancer recovery," "post-surgery clients," "people with mobility disabilities," "exercise referral"
- Emphasize: NOT about weight loss or aesthetics, but about capability and independence

Changes in the Qualifications section:
- Lead with: "Most trainers hold Level 3. I hold Level 4 BECAUSE I specialize in complex cases."
- Reorder quals: Cancer Rehab first (most valuable differentiator), then Exercise Referral, then Level 4

Changes in the Experience section:
- Already strong, but add: "I've trained clients with cancer, spinal injuries, visual impairment, post-natal concerns, and much more"
- Clarify: "If you think your situation is 'too complex,' you're wrong. That's exactly what I'm qualified for."

TASK 2: Update Personal Training Page
File: app/personal-training/PersonalTrainingClient.tsx

Hero section:
- Current angle: Generic "personalized training"
- New angle: Lead with "For people whose health conditions exclude them from generic fitness"
- Add: "Level 4 qualified. Specialist in cancer rehabilitation, exercise referral, disability adaptation."

Main content sections:
- Add specific client examples: "People recovering from cancer treatment," "Those with mobility disabilities," "Post-surgery clients," "People with chronic health conditions"
- Remove: Generic "results" language
- Replace with: "Capability, independence, confidence, safe progression"

CTAs:
- Current: "Book a consultation"
- New: "Book a consultation to discuss your health condition and training needs"

TASK 3: Update Homepage Sections
File: app/HomePageClient.tsx and component files:
- HeroSection: Lead with "Specialist personal training for health conditions"
- WhySection: Emphasize "who I specialize with" (health conditions, disabilities, cancer recovery)
- SpecialiseSection: Update titles/content to health conditions focus
- WhoSection: Change from generic fitness personas to health condition personas
- All CTAs: Say "Discuss your health condition" not just "Book a consultation"

Verification:
- Read each section aloud - does it sound like specialist coaching for health conditions, or generic fitness?
- Look for words: "transformation," "weight," "loss," "body change," "aesthetic" - these should be GONE
- Look for words: "health condition," "specialist," "Level 4," "cancer," "disability," "recovery" - these should be PRESENT
```

## SESSION 5: ADD SCHEMA MARKUP
**Priority:** ⚠️ MEDIUM — Enables rich snippets  
**Timeline:** 2-3 hours  
**Owner:** Frontend/Dev (SEO knowledge required)

### Deliverables
- [ ] Add FAQPage schema to `/faqs` page
- [ ] Add Article schema to blog post template
- [ ] Verify in Google Rich Results Test

**Task Description for New Session:**
```
You are adding structured data (schema markup) to two page types.

Why: Google uses schema to show rich snippets in search results (e.g., FAQ snippets). This increases click-through rate.

TASK 1: Add FAQ Schema to FAQs Page
File: app/faqs/page.tsx

Add this schema in the page component (before the FAQSection render):

const faqSchema = {
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Can you train with cancer?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes. Esther is Level 4 qualified with cancer rehabilitation certification. She specializes in training clients through and after cancer treatment, with safe progression protocols and medical awareness."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What if I have a disability or mobility limitation?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Adaptations are built into every session. Esther has extensive experience with mobility limitations, visual impairment, and other disabilities. Training is tailored to your specific situation."
      }
    },
    // ... repeat for each FAQ item
  ]
};

Then add to metadata (like the Personal Training page already does):
<script type="application/ld+json" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(faqSchema) }} />

TASK 2: Add Article Schema to Blog Posts
File: app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx

For each blog post, add Article schema:

const articleSchema = {
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "NewsArticle",
  "headline": post.title,
  "description": post.excerpt,
  "image": post.image_url,
  "datePublished": post.published_at,
  "dateModified": post.published_at,
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Esther Fair",
    "url": "https://eternalfitness.co.uk/about",
    "jobTitle": "Level 4 Personal Trainer"
  },
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Eternal Fitness",
    "logo": {
      "@type": "ImageObject",
      "url": "https://eternalfitness.co.uk/logo.png"
    }
  }
};

Then render in the page.

TASK 3: Verify with Google Rich Results Test
URL: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results

- Paste homepage URL → should show Organization schema
- Paste FAQ page URL → should show FAQPage schema
- Paste blog post URL → should show NewsArticle schema

Look for: Green checkmarks, no errors, schema properly recognized.
```

## SESSION 6: INTERNAL LINKING & TOPIC CLUSTERING
**Priority:** ⚠️ MEDIUM — Improves topical authority  
**Timeline:** 3-4 hours  
**Owner:** SEO/Content Strategy

### Deliverables
- [ ] Create topic cluster map (visual or spreadsheet)
- [ ] Add internal links to blog posts (related articles + /personal-training)
- [ ] Verify no broken links

**Task Description for New Session:**
```
You are creating a topic clustering strategy and implementing internal linking.

Why: Google uses internal links to understand content relationships and topic authority. Linking related blog posts together tells Google they're part of the same topic cluster.

TASK 1: Create Topic Cluster Map
Create a spreadsheet or visual document showing:

Cluster 1: Cancer Rehabilitation
├─ Blog: "Cancer & Exercise: What's Safe During Treatment & Recovery"
├─ Blog: "Exercise & Illness" (existing post)
└─ Link to: /personal-training page

Cluster 2: Mobility & Disability
├─ Blog: "Strength Training with Mobility Limitations"
├─ Blog: "Fall Prevention & Balance"
└─ Link to: /personal-training page + /about page

Cluster 3: Post-Surgery Recovery
├─ Blog: "Safe Post-Surgery Strength Progression"
├─ Blog: "Managing Setbacks in Recovery" (reframed post)
└─ Link to: /personal-training page

Cluster 4: Health Conditions (Menopause, Arthritis, Diabetes, etc.)
├─ Blog: "Menopause & Exercise" (existing)
├─ Blog: "Training with Arthritis"
├─ Blog: "Diabetes & Exercise"
└─ Link to: /personal-training page

TASK 2: Add Internal Links to Existing Blog Posts
For each blog post, add 2-3 related links:

Example in "Cancer & Exercise" post:
"For more on safe progression after cancer treatment, see our guide on [cancer rehabilitation training](/personal-training)."

"You can also read about [exercise during illness](/blog/exercise-illness) for broader context on activity during health challenges."

Link format: Use descriptive anchor text with health condition keywords
Avoid: "Click here," "Read more" (bad for SEO)

TASK 3: Update /personal-training page with blog links
On the Personal Training page, add a section:

"Related Articles:
- [Cancer & Exercise: What's Safe During Treatment & Recovery](/blog/cancer-exercise)
- [Strength Training with Mobility Limitations](/blog/strength-mobility-disabilities)
- [Managing Setbacks in Your Recovery Journey](/blog/managing-recovery-setbacks)"

TASK 4: Verify Links
- Click every link and verify destination page loads
- Check that anchor text makes sense in context
- No broken internal links (404s)
```
